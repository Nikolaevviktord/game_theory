# Data structure  (DS)

The `struct data_struct` has two fields: `std::vector<bool> enemy_solutions` (all previous decisions of the opponent) and `int round_num` (the current round number). Each function receives an object of type `data_struct` as input and should return a variable of type bool â€” a decision to cooperate or betray (where `true` means cooperation and `false` means betrayal).
